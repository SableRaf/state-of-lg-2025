# Inkscape project notes for Libre Graphic Meeting 2025

Inkscape is an open source vector editor, working on the SVG standard (Scalable Vector Graphics). The project started in 2003 and is still in excellent health 21 years later, thanks to its very active community of users, contributers and developpers

New major versions are released every 1 or 2 years since 2019, with minor releases every 6 months or so.

## For the 2024-2025 period

v.1.4 were release in oct. 2024 and the first update 1.4.2 is available since may 2025. Some highlights on the work done for these :

- Inkscape improved support of other vector file formats : enhanced PDF conversion, Inkscape now better handles Affinity Designer and Vectornator/Linearity. In spirit of FOSS, we work to keep files editable after leaving proprietary or abandoned softwares.
- Tools : shapebuilder now handles direct bitmap picture clipping, a new modular grid to ease layouts works is now available + more control on axonometric grids.
- UI : a new font browser panel, including preview and collection management. Filters now have a gallery that should help to better understand their effect before apply them. The object properties panel can now also be used to modify the controls of special objects such as rectangles, ellipses, stars, ect. and is a first step towards a deeper reworking of the properties panel.
- Great work were made around stability, with more than 200 bugs fixed since the last1.3.2 version.


## Project, community and infrastructure (not a slide)

- Regular meetings for developpers started in May 2025
- We have a new webserver, using Weblate, where Inkscape can be translated online : translate.inkscape.org
- Work started for future version of Inkscape website
- Matrix currently in test to replace Rocket.chat

## For next 1.5 and beyond

In the next major version, a special focus will be on :

- Porting Inkscape on GTK4 (currently in GTK3 since Inkscape 1.0)
- A huge work already done and still in progress on color profile support, a feature closely intertwined with the full PDF support.
- This year again, Inkscape takes part to the Google Summer Of Code. As in 2024, the project also runs a bugfix accelerator paid program, to tackle some long term problems.
- As mentioned earlier, a deep rework on tab management and dialog is on the table : optimize space side panels take, make object properties more context sensitive, more logic and fluid for newcomer and seasoned users.

**P.S.** : Those slides were 100% made in Inkscape, including layout, artwork and backgrounds. Even icons you can see in the Inkscape screenshot ;).
