## Slide 1 - Mission

![](hyper8-1.png)

The three core aims of the project are:

1. Independence:
   Enable publishing that's independent from big platforms or
   potentially fragile community infrastructure.

2. Accessibility:
   Provide a system that is usable for the widest audience possible,
   especially to those without a professional technical background.

3. Sustainability:
   Facilitate long-term availability of publications,
   especially in environments that are precarious in terms of financing,
   personal resources, or institutions involved.

Hyper 8 already offers a solid foundation for video publishing, including,
for instance, support for subtitles, embeds, Atom and RSS feeds, platform
integration, theming, localization, and more.

In the coming months Hyper 8 will be extended with built-in FTP deployment,
audio-only formats, transcripts, improved accessibility, refined design and
layouts, and most importantly, full desktop integration of the application.
