## Slide 2 - Roadmap

![](friction-2.png)

Our long and short term roadmap is:

- New project file format
  - Probably XML or SQLite
- Continued improvement of UI/UX
- Better SVG, CSS and SMIL compatibility
- Better image format (and layer) support
  - Will probably integrate OpenImageIO
- Improved general audio support and playback
- Addition of common NLE features
  - We want to include more NLE functionality
    - Mostly timeline related stuff
  - Support disk cache for previews/renders
    - Currently cache is limited by RAM
  - Color management using OpenColorIO and/or LCMS
- Integration with other applications
  - Inkscape
  - kdenlive
- Support for Android (tablets)
  - Custom TUI (touch user interface) for tablets
- Development of a funding strategy
  - The project needs to figure out a way to stay sustainable (pay for development and maintenance)
